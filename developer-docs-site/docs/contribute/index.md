# Contribute to Aptos

We welcome your own [contributions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the Aptos blockchain and this site! In fact, every contributor to Aptos.dev is listed as an *author* on the pages they edit and update. See the *Authors* list at the bottom of any page other than this for example. See the [Aptos Docs](https://github.com/orgs/aptos-labs/projects/14/views/1) project for open issues by status.

[Create a pull request](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pulls) to make updates and [file issues](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/issues) to report problems.

Simply click *Edit this page* at the bottom of any location to go to the source and trigger editing there. The contents are in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) format. You may then edit in browser and use the *Preview* function to view your changes.

Or to edit at the command line and preview your changes on your localhost, see our [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/developer-docs-site/README.md) README.

When ready, [start a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes. We will get back to you shortly.

Finally, you may report problems and supply other input in the [#docs-feedback](https://discord.com/channels/945856774056083548/1034215378299133974) channel of [Aptos Discord](https://discord.gg/aptoslabs).

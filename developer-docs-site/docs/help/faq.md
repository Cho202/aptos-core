### What makes Aptos unique compared to alternative blockchains?

We have a specific focus on building a safe, scalable and upgradeable blockchain with credible neutrality.  [](https://aptos.dev/transactions/interacting-with-the-aptos-blockchain)

We have a head start, as we are the original creators, researchers, designers, and builders of Diem, the blockchain that was first built to serve this purpose. We use the Move language, the safe and reliable language originally developed for Diem.

Join the Discord channel [Aptos Move language channel](https://discord.com/channels/945856774056083548/955573698868432896) and get involved. 

Also see [Interacting with Aptos Blockchain](https://aptos.dev/guides/interacting-with-the-aptos-blockchain) document. 

What types of projects would be interesting and uniquely suited for Aptos blockchain platform?

We are building a general purpose blockchain development platform, so the many use cases range from decentralized finance to gaming, NFTs, Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and beyond!

### *What changed from Diem to Aptos?*

We have focused upon:

  * going from permissioned to permissionless → proof of authority to proof of stake
  * encouraging safety and performance
  * making major changes to storage
  * clear path to 100k TPS

## Aptos Incentivized Testnet

### What is Aptos Incentivized Testnet?

The Aptos Incentivized Testnet (AIT) is a series of incentivized programs offered by Aptos Labs to the Aptos community. The purpose of these incentivized testnets is for Aptos community and Aptos team to progressively build a secure, reliable, decentralized network towards a production-grade Aptos mainnet. 

See the latest update on AIT in this [Aptos blog post](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/launch-of-aptos-incentivized-testnet-registration-2e85696a62d0). 

### When can I participate in the incentivized testnet?

Registration for AIT1 has begun on 13 May 2022. See the latest schedule update on this [Aptos Community](https://community.aptoslabs.com/) page and [in this Aptos blog post](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-update-abcfcd94d54c). 

### Can anyone in the world participate in the incentivized testnet?

The identity of all the participants will be verified prior to the AIT1 lottery event. You may not be qualified to participate, and some participants may not be eligible for token-based rewards. See below for a quick summary. See the latest update in this [Aptos blog post](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-update-abcfcd94d54c). 

Participation

- If you are on a sanctions or other screening list from the US, EU, UN and certain other countries, then you cannot participate.
- If you are a citizen or resident of Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions, Iran, or Syria, then you cannot participate.

Rewards

- U.S. participants: Because of regulatory considerations, participants who are either citizens of the U.S., or who are residents in the United States are not eligible for the token-based rewards. We are looking into non-token awards but there is no guarantee that any such rewards will be available to US participants.

## App and Move development

### How do you generate FT and NFT tokens without issuing modules using “token.move” with Aptos Framework?

* You can call the entry functions of token.move (such as [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move#L338-L395](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move#L338-L395) ) directly via the fullnode API by signing+submitting a transaction using any of our supported SDKs (more to come) or via the `aptos cli`. This allows you to create tokens without writing any Move code.


### How do you ensure data security and token control. What are the pros on the Aptos side of publishing a token without a module (smart contract) that it is designed differently from languages such as Solidity, Cairo, Sway?

* There are several benefits to issuing tokens using `token.move` instead of redeploying your own contract code every time, for example:
    * Well understood+tested security: You know that if you interact with a 0x1 contract that you have certain guarantees, for example: there is no way to `cheat` and magically mint beyond the specified limits, etc. In general all our core modules (part of aptos framework) are rigorously tested.
    * Interoperability: All tokens created by token.move follow a certain standard and static type, expose certain common functions (such as to transfer a token) and common events, such as when a token is removed/deposited from a token store. This makes it easy for wallets+marketplace and other apps in the ecosystem to display rich information, allow transfers, listings and also to build additional use-cases/apps or even Move contracts on top of your token, which enhances the utility of your token.
* Note that our `token.move` module is an enhanced variant of ERC1155.
* Note that `token.move` supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
* Note that all the aforementioned benefits similarly apply to `coin.move` - our preferred module for coins.

### Can you explain the type_of (type_info.move) service technically and conceptually? Can you instantiate this service that defines the address, module and structure of a particular type at runtime? (It will be helpful for us to fully understand.)

* Type_of gives runtime type reflection, this is available at runtime as part of the aptos_std.
* It can be helpful for inspecting runtime types. For example, if you have a generic function, this can be used to ensure that only a few types of generics (or generics from as specific module, etc) are allowed, or what addresses defined them

### Can we define our own structs on the Aptos blockchain? By defining interface (struct for move) in Solidity language, we can perform operations by hooking between contracts. No use of structs other than structs defined in the Bytecode layer?

* You absolutely can ! There is very little that is magic or special in our core frameworks
* For example you can define a struct:

    ```


     struct Weapon has key, store {


        name: String,


        damage: u32,


    }


    ```

* And use this struct in several other modules, including modules deployed in different accounts at a later point time.

### Data is kept in resources (user accounts), not modules. What is the purpose (security, privacy, etc.) and motivation for this? Doesn't reading the source data bound to each module add extra work and bytecode overhead to the modules (contracts)?

* Documentation: [https://aptos.dev/concepts/resources](https://aptos.dev/concepts/resources) 
* Associating data with the entity which owns it (the account user) has benefits for security, as this data can be protected by the signer of the account. There is no overhead coming from this.
* There are also benefits for sharding resources/states in different accounts.

### You mentioned in your Developer documentation that you prefer static type security over runtime security via Generics. What is the reason of this? Can code security issues occur in runtime security to be implemented with generics? (Please mention the difference between coin.move – token.move type security concept.

* We prefer static type via generics (coin.move) than runtime types via IDs (token.move).
* Security of static type is guaranteed by the compiler, there’s very little chance for it to go wrong.
* Security of runtime types is guaranteed by the developers, it’s more likely to result in bugs, but on the other hand it provides much more flexibility.
* We expect most coins to conform to the same standard, while NFTs would need much more flexibility, thus we made different decisions for them.

### If we create our own Gas Unit (gas-currency) on Aptos (with coin.move), can we pay for our Transactions with this Gas-Token instead of APT? Should we do this with our own nodes? Is it possible to produce only Gas-Token without Fiat-Token relationship? (This is due to the fact that millions of transactions can occur in a game and their costs are very high.)

* No, currently only APT can be used for gas. As you called out, the relationship to fiat makes this a very difficult problem to solve.
* We are working however on allowing subsidies- i.e allowing a contract or account to pay for storage or gas fees for user transactions.

### We know that with Token.move we can create many different (customized) on-chain NFT metadata. But plus, does token.move support dynamic metadata that we create on-chain? For example; such as combining and separating NFTs, which has two different metadata that are compatible with each other.

* We support dynamic metadata on-chain. The creator can customize properties and mutate the property values based on user interaction. 
* For combining NFTs, currently, you can write a function taking two NFTs and return a merged NFT in a resource account that can do this automatically. For separating NFT, you can have a function taking one NFT and returning multiple NFTs similarly.
* We are working on a standard for composable NFTs as well, and would love to hear more about your specific use case.

### Does Aptos use Key Rotation for both regular users and validators? Also, will Aptos validators benefit from different key recovery techniques? (Key Rotation or Key recovery will be a very good option if our nodes are attacked)

* Documentation: [https://aptos.dev/concepts/accounts#rotating-the-keys](https://aptos.dev/concepts/accounts#rotating-the-keys) 
* Yes, both regular users and validators can perform key rotations of various kinds and keys (e.g., consensus key). Key recovery is also an interesting idea, but we don't have immediate support for it. What kind of key recovery do you have in mind with the validators?
* Validator can rotate its consensus key using its account key which is essentially a consensus key recovery mechanism.

### Is it possible to share your minimum and maximum values (in sec) regarding transaction finality?

* Minimum latency is sub second, probably 800 to 900ms in the current mainnet setup
* Maximum latency is unfortunately unbounded, if there’re more transactions than the system can process, they’ll wait in a priority queue weighted by their gas price. The practical maximum is 10 minutes, after which things still-in-process are GC-ed and failed
* But that is only under more load than can be handled: in mainnet, the p99 has been ~1.2s since launch.
* Once consensus is reached on a transaction, the transaction is final. There are no forks, reorgs, etc on Aptos.

### Does Aptos run PaceMaker in the Hotstuff protocol structure? We've seen that AptosBFT is better than other BFT frameworks (in terms of leader consensus), but could the leader selection framework suffer from scaling issues as in pBFT?

* We don't use HotStuff anymore. We use Joltean, which improves latency. We don't rely on PaceMaker the same way the HotStuff paper does. We integrate it in our protocol and provide comprehensive liveness and safety proofs.
* Furthermore we have ongoing work to implement a variation of narwhal+tusk ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf)) - internally called Quorum Store - to decouple data and metadata to remove leaders as bottlenecks

### We cannot find the technical document at https://aptos.dev/docs/technical-papers/state-machine-replication-paper/. Could you please share a new link so we can take a look?

* [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/developer-docs-site/static/papers/aptos-consensus-state-machine-replication-in-the-aptos-blockchain/2022-09-14.pdf](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/developer-docs-site/static/papers/aptos-consensus-state-machine-replication-in-the-aptos-blockchain/2022-09-14.pdf) 
* We also recommend reading the whitepaper, which should be more up-to-date: [https://aptos.dev/aptos-white-paper/aptos-white-paper-index/](https://aptos.dev/aptos-white-paper/aptos-white-paper-index/)

### What is the probability of being attacked by BlockStore found in the AptosBFT consensus structure? As we understand, the primary exception to Actor Model is BlockStore. What is the security of Blockstore and is its immutability guaranteed with AptosBFT? Are tests available for this condition?

* Not sure I understand the question, the safety is guaranteed by the AptosBFT algorithm.
* The core safety rules are abstracted in the [SafetyRules](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/18bbf8fa42a18b40828a4e93fe5750933ba6c035/consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules.rs#L39) module.
* We have many tests around the consensus algorithm - unit tests, integration tests, chaos tests etc

### Block-STM uses Atomic Sequencer for parallel execution, if cancelled (unprocessed TXs) are processed by reordering, is TX Fee charged from the user for each iteration? Could the user abuse this situation and send transactions that are inversely dependent on each other, triggering that transactions are never approved but delayed? (for example: 1.TX Approve 2.TX Transfer instead of 1.TX Transfer 2.TX Approve or different transactions) The reason for this question is the possibility of high tx number to be processed in the game and the possibility of sending transactions out of order by us.

* Block-STM works on a pre-defined txn order (given by consensus), it extracts the inherent parallelism from the pre-defined order instead of trying to reorder them.
* What do you mean concretely by sending transactions “out of order”?
* TX fees are charged only once, irrespective of the number of iterations it took the BlockSTM executor to complete a TX. Most transactions will complete after 1-2 attempts. Note that if a transaction runs into a read-write conflict on the first attempt, BlockSTM extracts metadata to intelligently re-execute the conflicting transactions in a way that avoids conflicts, so the 2nd attempt going through is very high. To apply this to your example, if TX1 and TX2 run into a conflict on the first iteration, BlockSTM will “understand” that these _specific_ 2 transactions are in conflict with each other and then make sure they’re not run at the same time in the second iteration. If for example both TX1 and TX2 are trying to transfer a specific NFT to a different account, only one of them will eventually succeed. 

### Aptos accounts support Native Mutli-Sig (multi ED25519), can we design "native multi-sig" while coding Modules (smart-contracts)? On the Solidity side, we solved this structure with a very advanced Access Controller structure. This is a very important milestone for us to decentralize changes to the Game or DAO.

* Yes- if I understand the question correctly, Wormhole (Jump Crypto) has built out something that works similarly: they use resource accounts and Multi-Sig to create an upgrade system that requires multi-sig for their bridge: [https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/dev.v2/aptos/deployer/sources/deployer.move ](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/dev.v2/aptos/deployer/sources/deployer.move)
* There is also a proposal that we are working on internally to make this part of our core framework: multiple signers will be able to sign the same transaction asynchronously (and submit the signature on chain). When the number of signatures is above the threshold, the transaction can then be executed. More details [here](https://aptoslabs.notion.site/Multisig-accounts-a518df6e2af842f5b98519386624e37c).
